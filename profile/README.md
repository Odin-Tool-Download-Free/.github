## How Odin Tool Works  

Odin communicates with Samsung devices through **Download Mode**, a special boot mode activated by a key combination.  
Once connected, Odin detects the COM port, verifies firmware integrity, and writes system partitions directly to the phone’s internal memory.  

Users simply load firmware files into the designated slots:  
- **BL** (Bootloader)  
- **AP** (System / Recovery)  
- **CP** (Modem / Baseband)  
- **CSC** (Country / Region data)  

The program then performs a safe and automated flashing process, minimizing the risk of data loss or system corruption.
